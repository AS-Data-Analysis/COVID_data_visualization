# Distribution of COVID Data over the world

**The COVID data used for this visualization is dated 29th April, 2020 which was pretty early into the pandemic. Many countries had not even declared lockdowns despite having a high count of cases and deaths.

*The data is categorized region-wise where the regions are defined according to the UN SDG framework here. This framework defines 8 regions that comprise the world. It is worth noting that Antarctica is not included as a separate region for obvious regions. Moreover, Taiwan although having tracked COVID data and recorded by the UN is not an actual UN member country and therefore, is shown as a separate region.

*This pandemic has challenged healthcare industries all over the world to adapt and evolve to deal with the contagious COVID-19 virus threat.

*While rich countries were quick to respond to this pandemic by putting in place healthcare facilities to quarantine individuals and testing the population rapidly, poorer countries did not fare as well. This is why the overall data is lower for developing and under-developed countries even though the population is higher.
